Below is a list of toppings that are commonly served with ramen:

Chashu
  Fatty slices of roasted or braised pork. Chashu is a very common topping, and standard bowls of ramen usually come with one or two slices of it. Most ramen-ya also serve Chashumen (chashu ramen) which is a ramen dish with additional pieces of chashu. Kakuni (braised pork belly) is served instead of chashu at some restaurants.
Menma
  Preserved bamboo shoots with a salty flavor
Negi
  Chopped or shredded leeks or green onions. Karanegi is a spicy variation of shredded leeks mixed with chili oil. Negi is a ramen standard, while karanegi is often seen with miso ramen.
Moyashi
  Raw or cooked bean sprouts add sweetness and crunch. Served on all types of ramen.
Tamago
  Hard boiled, soft boiled, raw and marinated eggs are all popular toppings on any type of ramen.
Seaweed
  Various types of seaweed such as wakame and nori are commonly added to all types of ramen.
Kamaboko
  Slices of steamed fish cake. One type of kamaboko that is commonly served on ramen is naruto (or narutomaki), a sawtooth edged, white fish cake with a red or pink spiral design on it.
Corn
  Canned corn is often paired with butter and served on miso or shio ramen.
Butter
  A thick pat of butter adds creaminess and depth. Typically added to miso or shio ramen.
